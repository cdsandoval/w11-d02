How to use Node to help in the development.

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system, if you are in {codeable} bootcamp, you already installed the necessary files. 

After pulling the files in the repository do:

```npm install```

Which will install the required packages that were defined in `package.json`

Then do 
```npm start```

this will start `lite-server` which will load the `index.html` in your browser.

To stop the server, just press `ctrl + c`
